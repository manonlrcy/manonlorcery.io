						<h2> Why are tropical regions like rainforests and coral reefs so rich in species compared to temperate zones?</h2>
						<p> This striking global pattern, called the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG), has captivated scientists for over two centuries. 
							First documented by naturalists like Alexander von Humboldt and Charles Darwin, the LDG describes how species diversity tends to peak in the tropics and gradually declines toward the poles.
							But why does this pattern exist? Some theories point to the tropics as the evolutionary cradle of life, where many species originate and thrive due to higher rates of speciation compared to extinction. 
							Other ideas suggest the tropics act as a biodiversity reservoir, with species dispersing outwards while still flourishing in their tropical roots.

						Abiotic factors, such as climate stability, energy availability, and geographic area, also play crucial roles. 
						Large-scale shifts in Earth's climate over millions of years have likely shaped LDG patterns. 
						Exploring these patterns through deep time offers new insights. Fossil records reveal that the steep LDG we see today only fully emerged in the last 30 to 40 million years, particularly during cooler "icehouse" periods. 
						Earlier, during warmer eras like the Early Paleocene and Eocene, LDGs were flatter, with no clear tropical dominance. 
						While marine fossil records provide extensive evidence of LDG changes, terrestrial records are patchier, making it harder to decipher patterns on land.
						To bridge these gaps, scientists are turning to mechanistic modelsâ€”powerful tools that simulate how biodiversity evolves across dynamic landscapes. 
						Our recent research uses one such model, gen3sis, to investigate how Earth's shifting climate, geology, and surface processes shaped mammal diversity over the past 125 million years. 
						By simulating scenarios based on climate and surface processes, we can track changes in speciation, extinction, and species richness on a global scale, offering a deeper understanding of the forces driving biodiversity through Earth's history.</p>
